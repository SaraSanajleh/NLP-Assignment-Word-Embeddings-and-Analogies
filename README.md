# NLP-Word-Embeddings-and-Analogies

📌 Project Overview

The goal of the assignment to explore and compare Word2Vec and GloVe word embeddings through custom-designed analogy tests.

🔨 Implementation

Loaded pre-trained Word2Vec and GloVe embeddings.

Designed 10 semantic and 10 syntactic analogy tests (originally created, not from existing datasets).

Implemented cosine similarity manually for analogy evaluation.

Evaluated and compared model performance.

📊 Results

Semantic Analogies:

Word2Vec Accuracy → 40%

GloVe Accuracy → 60%

Syntactic Analogies:

Word2Vec Accuracy → 70%

GloVe Accuracy → 60%

➡️ Conclusion:

GloVe performed better in capturing semantic relationships.

Word2Vec performed better in capturing syntactic patterns.

The choice of model depends on the nature of the task.
